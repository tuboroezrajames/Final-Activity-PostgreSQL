Task 3

Aware of the reality that equity crowdfunding is a bit rare in financial services,
determine whether or not there has been a previous instance where a startup
offering financial services received equity crowdfunding. If there was, provide
details of the company, such as the country it operates in, the year it was
founded, its status (whether or not it is still operating), and the amount of 
equity crowdfunding it acquired*/

Task 4

Determine whether or not a significant outlier in terms of total funding (USD)
exists among companies that offer financial services.
An outlier is an extremely high or low value. Provide details about this outlier, 
such as its country, status, year founded, and total funding (USD).*/
